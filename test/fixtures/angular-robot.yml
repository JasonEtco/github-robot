  # {{MERGE_LABEL}} will be replaced by the value of the mergeLabel option
  # {{PLACEHOLDER}} will be replaced by the list of failing checks
  mergeRemovedComment: "I see that you just added the `{{MERGE_LABEL}}` label. It won't do anything good though, because the following checks are still failing:
\n{{PLACEHOLDER}}
\n
\nIf you want your PR to be merged, it has to pass all the checks. But if you have a good reason to want to merge this, please contact the caretaker to let them know."
