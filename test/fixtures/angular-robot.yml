  mergeRemovedComment: "I don't like to brag, but I just saved you from a horrible, slow and painful death by removing the `{{MERGE_LABEL}}` label. Probably. Maybe...
\nThe following checks are failing:
\n{{PLACEHOLDER}}
\n
\nBut if you think that you know better than me, then please, go ahead, add the `{{OVERRIDE_LABEL}}` label and add an override justification comment for the caretaker. You'll be free to do whatever you want. Don't say that I didn't warn you."
